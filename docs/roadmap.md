## Project Roadmap

The first phase of this project is to create an English language dictionary using [Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2/tree/master/Spec/Data) and the [Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Script (Script2) library](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2) and create a script to replace all of the works in the English language Wikipedia with indexes. At this point we will not have anywhere near enough RAM so we'll have to do memory tricks.

In the second phase of the project we will use Interactive adversarial twin AI to do hide and seek games to compress as much data into RAM as possible. To complete this phase we will have found a grant for a 64-core AMD Epyic CPU with 1TB of RAM, 8x20TB hard drives, and a beefy nVidia RTX GPU that will function as our primary learning server, and another identical machine for a development server without the hard drives.
